I'm not entirely sure where I found this module, but I didn't write it initially. The purpose is to restrict what roles a user is allowed to send messages to, The default support only allows you to block messaging certain roles, which doesn't work for our purposes. 

I'm putting this in git so that I can upgrade it for D7.
